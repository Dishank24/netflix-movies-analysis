## Problem Statement:
Analyze and predict the viewership and success of movies and TV shows on a streaming platform based on various attributes such as type, title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, listed in, and description.

Specifically, I want to answer the following questions and perform tasks related to this dataset:

Viewership and Popularity Analysis:

What are the most popular types of content on the platform (Movies or TV Shows)?
Which countries contribute the most content?
Does the release year affect the popularity of content?

Content Duration Analysis:

Are there any trends in content duration over the years?

Genre Analysis:

Which genres are most prevalent on the platform?
Are there any trends in the popularity of specific genres?

Country Analysis:

Do viewers have a preference for content from certain countries?

Predictive Modeling:

Building a model to predict the success (e.g., viewership, ratings) of a movie or TV show based on its attributes?
By addressing these questions and tasks, the streaming platform can gain insights into its content library, viewer preferences
